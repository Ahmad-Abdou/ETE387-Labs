The number of bits assigned to the exponent determines the *range* of the representation, while the number of bits in the fraction determines the *precision*.\n",

Unlike tf32, which is primarily used for internal computations, bf16 can be directly stored and used for activations, weights, and gradients, which can save memory (16 bits per value instead of 32)."
