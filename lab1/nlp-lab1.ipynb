The keyword argument `dim=-2` ensures that the mean is calculated across the columns of all vectors, rather than within each single vector. The mean vector is passed through the final linear layer.

The default initialisation method for linear layers in PyTorch is the so-called Kaiming initialisation, introduced by [He et al.
