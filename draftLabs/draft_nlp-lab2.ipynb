Your task is to modify the code for the `generate()` function to use a **sampling-based approach** instead. In this approach, the next token is chosen randomly based on the probabilities assigned by the model (softmax-normalised logits), treating them as a categorical distribution over the token vocabulary. Additionally, your code should include two common techniques to improve sampling:\n",

By today’s standards, GPT-2 is a small model with modest capabilities. However, it can still be helpful for certain tasks, such as text autocompletion, generating filler text, or answering simple questions. To rigourosly evaluate language models, researchers often use standard benchmark datasets. Creating these benchmarks is a discipline of its own, and they tend to become increasingly challenging as models continue to improve.\n",

HellaSwag is designed to test a model’s ability to perform commonsense reasoning in challenging contexts. Unlike simpler benchmarks, HellaSwag presents scenarios where the correct text completion depends on semantic relationships between events and on world knowledge. This makes it a good choice for assessing the ability of language models to go beyond surface-level patterns and produce meaningful, context-aware predictions."
